Project Description:
A project is written in C++ to efficiently connect input data points allowing user observe the connection between data with fast run-time.

Input data example: "movie name, actor names, movie year"
Upon reading in data from a file, data points will be stores in nodes to construct a Graph with edges being the movie name/year to connecting the nodes.
Users can then observe the connection between each node. The project using algorithms including DFS and Dijkstra.
